# A-MERN-Web-App

This a simple web application which basically uses all the neccessary format which will be useful for building great web applications.
This app is based on MERN stacks which basically uses:
  - **MongoDB** : as a database
  - **Express** : which is a simple yet great framework
  - **React.js** : which a library but still very powerfull (for frontend)
  - **NodeJS** : this whole project will be based on the Framework.

## Requirements
  NodeJS and npm is required for this project since we are using it for building. :)

## Installation
  After installing NodeJS and latest version of npm , run the following command to install the required packages.
  In the terminal, run 
  ```js
   npm install 
  ```
  This will install all the package we have used in our web app.
  
 ## Running
 
 The client-side or the frontend will use port 3000.
 So, to run client side seperately use
 ```js
  cd client 
   (to get inside to client folder and)
   
   npm start
 ```
 this will open the frontend in http://localhost:3000/ .
